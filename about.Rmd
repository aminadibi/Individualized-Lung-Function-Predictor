#### About 

This web application is built for the individualized prediction of lung function decline based on 3 models:

1. Prediction of future lung function decline based on baseline FEV1

2. Prediction of future lung function decline based on baseline FEV1 and patients' clinical characteristics

3. Prediction of future lung function decline based on baseline FEV1, patients' clinical characteristics, and 1-year prior history of FEV1.
