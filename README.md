## Individualized-Lung-Function-Predictor

Individualized Lung Function Predictor is a web app that provides patient-specific projections of lung function for individuals with COPD.  For research behind this app, please refer to [this page](http://resp.med.ubc.ca/research/resp/epic/lhs/)


developed by the RESP group at the University of British Columbia

Lung function decline can be estimated using this app, based on one of the three models below:

1. Prediction of future lung function decline based on baseline FEV1

2. Prediction of future lung function decline based on baseline FEV1 and patients' clinical characteristics

3. Prediction of future lung function decline based on baseline FEV1, patients' clinical characteristics, and 1-year prior history of FEV1.
